# loops

## Instructions

1. fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/JoinCODED/TASK-loops/)
2. read the comments and solve the task 👏🏼

#### Running Your Code

To run the code you're writing without running the automated tests, call the function you'd like to test manually in `funcions.js` and run the following command:

```bash
$ node loops.js
```

#### Running The Tests

Install all the requirements:

1. Navigate to the project root (you'll find a file called `package.json` there).
2. Install the required packages with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

Run the tests:

```bash
$ npm test
```

This command will run the testing file and test your code to make sure it has all the required features.

You'll know when you're done when your code passes all the tests.
